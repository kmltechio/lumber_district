# lumber_district

Configuration and automation settings for an N scale layout modeled off of CB&Q's Lumber District in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood during the 1950s/60s.

Trains on the main section of the layout are powered by DCC signals generated by [CommandStation-EX](https://dcc-ex.com/ex-commandstation/index.html) running on an [Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3) with an [Arduino Motor Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/collections/shields/products/arduino-motor-shield-rev3) and a [Makerfabs ESP8266 WiFi shield](https://www.makerfabs.com/esp8266-wifi-shield.html). 

A secondary track can toggle between DCC Programming mode and DC power to run legacy DC locomotives. This will most often run a street trolley with automation scripted by [EX-RAIL](https://dcc-ex.com/ex-rail/index.html). 

Mimic panels are designed around [Berret Hill Touch Toggles](https://www.berretthillshop.com/store/products/touch-controls/) driven by custom code loaded onto an [Arduino Nano Every](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/collections/boards/products/arduino-nano-every) which communicates with the Mega over I2C

Also on the I2C bus are two 16pin GPIO expanders to activate [L289N H Bridges](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RS3P1ZW) which drive the Kato Unitrack snap turnouts.

Finally an Arduino Nano Every with custom code drives static and animated LED lighting across the layout.

## TODOs

1. Investigate use of [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) with make instead of manualing clicking in Arduino IDE.
1. Investigate hostname/xfinity issue
1. Enter roster into myAutomation.h
    1. Verify in serial monitor?
    1. Test in Train Driver
    1. Setup images in Train Driver
